# AdThrive Quick Video Setup Tool ‚ö°Ô∏è (v2.0)

This tool allows you to quickly complete the initial video setup for our publishers (*yay!* üéâ).

## Usage

This guide assumes you know how to create new properties in the JW Player dashboard.

1. Log in to the [JW Player Dashboard](https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/welcome "JW Player Dashboard") and create a new property for the site that is being setup with video.

2. Click the menu button in the upper right-hand corner of the page (the cog just to the right of your email address) and select **"API Credentials"** from the dropdown menu.

3. Locate the property you just created and click **"Show Credentials"** to display the API Key and API Secret (you'll need these in a moment).

4. Open the [AdThrive Quick Video Setup Tool](https://focused-blackwell-01563a.netlify.com/ "AdThrive Quick Video Setup Tool") in a new browser tab.

5. Enter the site's name in the "Site Name" field and then copy/paste the API Key and API Secret into their respective fields.

6. Click the submit button and watch the tool work its magic ‚ú®.

7. Copy/paste the data that appears on the right (it will appear as pink text) into the appropriate fields in the internal portal.


# Additional Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
